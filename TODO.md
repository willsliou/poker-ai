## TO-DO

- create poker card game
- develop strategies (conservative, aggressive, neutral) (game theory)
- implement ai (think 2-3 steps ahead) (Use Counterfactual Regret Minimization (minimize regret) because changing states in poker exist as opposed to traditional ML reinforcement learning where results are verified. Monte Carlo?)
